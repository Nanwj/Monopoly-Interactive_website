        <p class="game-intro-item">Brisbane City Hall: When the player answers the question correctly, he will get the property of this point, and can charge rent to the next player passing by this point.</p>
        <p class="game-intro-item">Park: Each park has a different function. Some can add stars to the player, while others can confiscate them.</p>
        <p class="game-intro-item">Library: When you answer a question correctly, you will get 5 stars, but you don't keep the library for yourself</p>
        <p class="game-intro-item">Museum: When you answer a question correctly, you will get 8 stars, but you don't keep the museum for yourself</p>
